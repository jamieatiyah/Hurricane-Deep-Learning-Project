# Hurricane Damage Prediction using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting the post-hurricane damage status of buildings using transfer learning and deep learning algorithms, specifically VGG16 and ResNet50. The implementation is documented in the Python notebook, "Hurricane_Dataset.ipynb," while the analysis and findings are summarized in the report titled "Prediction of Post-Hurricane Damage Status Using Deep Learning Algorithms."

## Overview

In this project, deep learning models (VGG16 and ResNet50) were employed to assess post-hurricane damage in houses through the analysis of satellite imagery. The models were trained on a dataset comprising 10,000 images of both damaged and undamaged houses from Hurricane Harvey.

## Key Highlights

- **Model Development:** Utilized VGG16 and ResNet50 for post-hurricane damage assessment.
- **Training Data:** Trained on a dataset of 10,000 satellite images from Hurricane Harvey.
- **Performance:** Achieved notable results, with VGG16 reaching an accuracy of 80.85% and an F1 score of 0.8341.
- **Techniques:** Effectively utilized image augmentation techniques and conducted ROC-AUC analysis for model evaluation.

## Project Artifacts

- **Python Notebook:** The core implementation of the deep learning models is available in the notebook [Hurricane_Dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/jamieatiyah/Hurricane-Deep-Learning-Project/blob/main/Hurricane_Dataset.ipynb).
- **Report:** A short and structured report, ["Prediction of Post-Hurricane Damage Status Using Deep Learning Algorithms"](https://github.com/jamieatiyah/Hurricane-Deep-Learning-Project/blob/main/Prediction%20of%20Post-Hurrican%20Damage%20Status%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20Algorithms.pdf), provides insights into the analysis and results, following the style of an IEEE report.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the potential of deep learning models, especially VGG16, for rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage classification using satellite imagery. These models hold significant promise for aiding emergency response efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters. However, further research and optimization are necessary to enhance model generalization and reduce computational costs for real-world applications.
